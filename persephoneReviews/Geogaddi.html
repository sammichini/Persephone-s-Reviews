                <b> Many have described Geogaddi as one of BOC's darker works. Listening to this mysteriously nostalgic album will certainly send you into deep contemplation. 
                <br> The themes explored are rich and expand far beyond the "dark", into an appeciation for the astounding mathematical nature of music, the wonder of man landing on the moon,
                <br> and the urgency of protecting the natural world of the Earth and universe. </b>

            <b>When the album unveiled in January of 2002, it was mostly unannounced and had limited distribution. </b>
            <br> 
            <b>It was released during listening parties held at churches in the following cities:</b>
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>London</li>
            <li>New York City</li>

            <li>Paris</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>
        <br> The darkness shrouding the album is of course no accident. Various other themes present include:

        <p>On the meaning of the album name, member Mike Sandison said:</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://bocpages.org/wiki/Geogaddi">
                "Usually, our titles are self-explanatory, but this record's title is a composite that has more than one meaning.  
                <br> We have a meaning we understand from it, but it's up to listeners to choose their own meaning. 
                <br> I suppose the nature thing has an indirect effect on us while we're writing, because we're out here in the country most of the time. 
                <br> We're both heavily interested in science, too, which crosses over into nature and probably comes through in the music."
